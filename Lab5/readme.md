## 1.  
(Find the smallest n such that ) Use a while loop to find the smallest
integer n such that  is greater than 12000



 



## 2.     
(Find the factors of an integer) Write a
program that reads an integer and displays all its smallest factors in
increasing order. For example, if the input integer is 120, the output should
be as follows: 2, 2, 2, 3, 5



 



## 3.     
(Display pyramid) Write a program that
prompts the user to enter an integer from 1 to 15 and display a pyramid, as
shown in the following run:



Enter the number of lines: 7



7 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7



6 5 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5 6



5 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5



4 3 2 1 2 3 4



3 2 1 2 3



2 1 2



1



 



## 4.     
(Summation) Write a program to compute
the following summation.





 



## 5.     
(Math: combinations) Write a program
that displays all possible combinations for picking two numbers from integers 1
to 7. Also display the total number of all combinations.



1       
2



1       
3



…



…



The total number
of all combinations is 21.



 



## 6.     
(Occurrence of max numbers) Write a
program that reads integers, finds the largest of them, and counts its
occurrences. Assume the input ends with number 0. Suppose you entered 3  5  2  5 
5  5  0; the program finds that the largest is 5
and the occurrence count for 5 is 4.



(Hint: Maintain two variables, max and count. max stores
the current max number and count stores its occurrences. Initially, assign the first number to max and 1
to count. Compare each subsequent number with max. If the number is
greater than max, assign it to max and reset count to 1. If the number is equal to max, increment count by
1.)



 



Enter numbers: 3  5  2 
5  5  5  0



The largest number is 5



The occurrence count of the largest number is 4



 



## 7.     
(Emirp) An emirp (prime spelled
backward) is a nonpalindromic prime number whose reversal is also a prime. For
example, 17 is a prime and 71 is a prime, so 17 and 71 are emirps. Write a
program that displays the first 120 emirps. Display 10 numbers per line,
separated by exactly one space.



 



## 8.     
(Twin primes) Twin primes are a pair of
prime numbers that differ by 2. For example, 3 and 5 are twin primes, 5 and 7
are twin primes, and 11 and 13 are twin primes. Write a program to find all
twin primes less than 1200. Display the output as follows:



(3, 5)



(5, 7)
